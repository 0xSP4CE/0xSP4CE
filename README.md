## ðŸ‘‹ Hi !

Iâ€™m a fullstack developer specialized in building clean, responsive web applications using Vue.js, Nuxt, and Tailwind CSS. I focus on creating fast, intuitive, and maintainable user interfaces.

On the backend, I work primarily with Node.js (Express), and occasionally with Laravel, depending on the projectâ€™s needs. Iâ€™m particularly interested in designing robust APIs, implementing secure authentication, and ensuring backend reliability in production environments.

Beyond the web stack, I take interest in Lua and enjoy working with Linux servers, from initial setup to deployment automation and infrastructure management.
